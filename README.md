# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Forecasting for India
This notebook focuses on analyzing the COVID-19 outbreak in India using various visualizations and machine learning techniques. Due to the inclusion of Plotly visualizations, loading the notebook may take some time. The primary objective of this analysis is to compare the outbreak situation in India with its neighboring countries and other severely affected countries worldwide. Additionally, the notebook aims to build machine learning and time series forecasting models to predict the future outbreak scenario in India.

I have considered the Lockdown effects on country's COVID-19 cases and also taken into account the GDP and Tourism of the country as they also give us a broader view about the rise in the COVID-19 cases.
